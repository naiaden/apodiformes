	"And makes us rather bear those ills we have\n"
	"Than fly to others that we know not of ?\n"
	"Thus conscience does make cowards of us all ,\n"
	"And thus the native hue of resolution\n"
	"Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought ,\n"
	"And enterprises of great pitch and moment\n"
	"With this regard their currents turn awry ,\n"
	"And lose the name of action .\n"
